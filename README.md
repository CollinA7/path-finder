# Project 3 - 'PathFinder'

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## A SPA that allows users to find National Parks based off of each State of the U.S

As a User
I want to login/sign-in to a website
So that when logged in I can find National Parks in my area
With information about the parks including 
An Image
Location 
And a list of amenities that the parks offer

## Technologies Used: 

Node.js, Express, GraphQL, React, React-Bootstrap, MongoDB, JWT Authentication, and WebFontLoader


### Directions for Future Development 

## Charitable Donations

We’d like to implement a feature underneath each National Park Card that allows for a quick and easy way to donate to the specific park that you’re viewing (If they accept donations)
